# League Of Legends

When it comes to games that Garrett has put several hours into over a short period of time, League of Legends is one of them. He started playing League of Legends in early 2020, and has already put **1,958** hours into the game. In league of legends there are five roles, Top, Jungle, Mid, Bottom, and Support. Garrett tends to play Jungle when he wants to be competitive, but still experiments with all of the roles. A jungler is basically a champion that defeats creatures in a jungle, and in between clearing these camps of creatures, they attempt to assist some of the other roles accomplish their goal of defeating the enemy. Some of the Junglers Garrett plays are shown below.

Kayn is a assassin who is faced with a demon within his scythe. As can be seen in the background, Kayn is at a constant battle within himself as to who will ultimately control his body. In the game, you get to decide who wins and who becomes the controller of the body. Kayn? or the demon Rhaast?

Ekko is a young boy who solved the impossible equations of time to save his group of friends who fell to their death. He created a way to reverse time over and over until he could find a way to save every single one of his friends, and now uses this ability to fight his enemies while traveling through time to revert damage dealt to him or change the outcome of a fight he wasn't happy with.

**Gragas**

Gragas is an absolute **UNIT** of a man standing at a staggering 7'2 tall and weighing in at 735 pounds. His sole purpose in life is to find a never ending brew, with the perfect taste. The keg he carries around is magical and permanently keeps his brew at the perfect drinking temperature no matter what.
