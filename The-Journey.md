# The Journey

After Garrett moved to Trinity, Alabama, he started attending East Lawrence Middle School and later East Lawrence High school. In high school, he performed fairly decent academically, but his main focus wasn't on normal sports like football or baseball, he focused on joining [JROTC](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junior_Reserve_Officers%27_Training_Corps) where he rose from a private all the way through the ranks to the highest achieveable rank for a student. He was also on the rifle team where he competed at a state level competition his senior year before heading to the University of Missouri to start college. At college Garrett began to study Computer Engineer and Computer Science, where he learned to code programs like the one shown below.
