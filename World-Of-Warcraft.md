# World Of Warcraft

As mentioned in [The Gamer](The-Gamer.md), [World of Wacraft](https://worldofwarcraft.com/en-us/) has held a very special place in the heart of Garrett. At a very young age, he watched his father play the game for hours at a time, intrigued by the complexity of the game as well as the fantasy of making your own character. After a few year, Garrett's father bought him World of Warcraft with all of the expansions up to Cataclysm. Garrett started a character which he eventually put **1,340** hours into named Selanokay.

After a couple of years, Garrett began exploring some of the other classes in the game, and ended up creating his current main character named Rippjawz, which he has now put **1,134** hours into. While it isn't quite as much as on Selanokay, the time has accumulated over a much shorter period of time.
