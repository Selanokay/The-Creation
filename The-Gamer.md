# The Gamer

Garrett has grown up his whole life a gamer. When he was at a very young age he started out playing SNES games like *Donkey Kong Country* while also watching his dad play [*World Of Warcraft*](World-Of-Warcraft.md). Shortly after this, his father bought him a PS2 and he started grinding *Guitar Hero 2* and *Guitar Hero 3*. Playing games continued to be an enjoyable pass time for Garrett, leading him to eventually get a Xbox 360, and then finally build his own computer.
